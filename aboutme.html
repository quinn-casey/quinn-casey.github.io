									<p>Hello, I'm Quinn Casey! I'm currently a third year graduate student at Dartmouth College studying astronomy. 
										Despite being from Northern Minnesota, it took me until grad school to start playing hockey (go Absolute Zeros).
										I received my B.S. in Astronomy & Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2021 (go Badgers) where I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.astro.wisc.edu/staff/tremonti-christy/">Christy Tremonti</a>.
										 </p>

									<p>At Dartmouth (go No Official Mascot), I serve as the graduate assembly chair where I advocate on behalf of graduate students in the Physics and Astronomy Department.
										 I also serve on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committee where we strive to make our science, our department, and our everyday interactions more equitable. 
										 Alongside <a href="https://jhcohn.github.io/index.html">Jonathan Cohn</a>, I founded the Graduate Academia Survival Program (GASP) which is a peer-mentorship program aimed at integrating first-year graduate students into our department and academia at large.
										 </p>

									<p>I am passionate about education and frequently serve as a teaching assistant for introductory and upper-level physics and astronomy courses. 
										I struggled to grasp abstract phenomena at times throughout undergrad, so I really enjoy thinking about differing methods of instruction and pedagogy. 
										In 2025, I was awarded the <a href="https://physics.dartmouth.edu/graduate/graduate-awards/selamawit-tsehaye-teaching-award">Selamawit Tsehaye Teaching Award</a> for my help in Physics 4 (E&M for pre-meds).
									</p>

									<p>Outside of work, I enjoy the lost art of relaxation in the form of watching movies (check out <a href="https://letterboxd.com/movie_enjoyer4/films/">what I've been watching</a>), cooking, and taking care of my plants.
									I like to get outside and do low-effort hikes when the New Hampshire weather cooperates.
